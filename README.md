# Aurelius Tabs

A Chrome extension that gives you a meditation by Marcus Aurelius 
every time that you open a new tab.

On opening, so as to not distract the user, the text is a very 
light color. On hover, the contrast becomes clear, and the text
can easily be read.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file.
2. In Chrome, go to `Settings -> More tools -> Extensions.`
3. At the top, toggle the `Developer Mode` switch on.
4. Select the `Load Unpacked` Option that appears in the top menu bar.
5. Point it to the `aurelius_tabs` directory.
6. Enable the `Aurelius Tabs` extension.
